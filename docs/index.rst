LiCSBAS
=======

This is current version of (amazing) LiCSBAS time series tool, originally developed by Dr. Yu Morishita during his visit of the University of Leeds.
We, the COMET team, continue with some minor improvements of the tool, to keep the project live. The original codes are available at https://github.com/yumorishita/LiCSBAS

The repository updated by COMET is here: https://github.com/comet-licsar/licsbas

The main extra features are explained in tutorial from the COMET InSAR Workshop 2021 - check new parameters ``--nullify`` in step 12, and ``--singular --only_sb`` in step 13 as (very) useful key changes.
